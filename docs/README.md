# Island Line, Isle of Wight UK

This is a representation of the Island Line, an 8.5 mile route connecting the north to the south regions of the Isle of Wight in Hampshire, UK. The route is electrified by 3rd rail and at the time of writing is serviced by 1938 former London Underground rolling stock classified under TOPS as Class 483.

Addition of this route to the Railway Operation Simulator has been made possible through the collaborative efforts of the newly formed development team, acting as a test to determine the feasibility of joint group map creation.

## The Simulation

The simulation includes a simple timetable representing weekday services on the line between Ryde Pier Head and Shanklin.

The route features all the main stations:

- Ryde Pier Head
- Ryde Esplanade
- Ryde St. John's Road
- Smallbrook Junction (For the Isle of Wight Steam Railway)
- Brading
- Sandown
- Lake
- Shanklin

as well as St. John's Road depot. Due to the lack of information on the speed limits of the line, the line speed is set mainly to 45mph. Ryde Pier, Ryde Esplanade Jct, Smallbrook Jct, Brading and Sandown area have speed limits of 20mph, with a 15mph on the approach to Shanklin. 

If you know of a reliable source for a more accurate description of the line speeds please let us know! 

## Development

As mentioned, Island Line is the first "open" project which invites contribution from anyone. Further contributions towards the project are welcome, be it through creation of additional timetables or improvements to the route representation/accuracy.
