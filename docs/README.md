# Island Line, Isle of Wight UK

This is a representation of the Borderlands line between Wrexham in North East Wales, and Bidston on the Wirral. The route totals 27 miles in length, and apart from a small section at Bidston is not electrified.

This is my first route to be published on GitHub, so forgive me if there are things out of place.

## The Simulation

The simulation includes a timetable representing services that occurred on Tuesday, 22nd Septenber 2020, There are fewer services to Wrexham Central owing to restrictions sorrounding social distamcing. As a result, most services will turn in the block at Wrexham General

The route features all the stations:

- Wrexham Central
- Wrexham General
- Gwersyllt
- Cefn-y-Bedd
- Caergwrle
- Hope (Flintshire)
- Penyffordd 
- Buckley
- Hawarden (where they make the wings for Airbus)
- Shotton
- Hawarden Bridge (which has a limited service)
- Neston
- Heswall
- Upton
- Bidston

as well as the sidings for UPM Shotton Paper, and Dee Marsh sidings. There are no depot facilities on this route. The linespeeds and distances have been taken from teh National Electronic Sectional Appendix, but may vary slightly from reality due to the limitations of the simulator.

## Development

This is my third published project on Railway Operations Sim. and my first on GitHub, it has been a steep learning curve,a nd I am thankful to Krizar for his help.
